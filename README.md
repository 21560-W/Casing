# Casing
## 2018-12-11
NB: We're still improving the designs to address some issues - see list of issues here: https://gist.github.com/VincentFrangi/16d6c7e6fa9e704bf9b25b019e6e9d70

## Variants
There are two casing variants:

### `original/`
All CAD and other designs for the AstroPlant original casing / enclosure / top panel.
This casing design requires a large laser cutter that can fit panels larger than 130cm in length.
The other files, developed by Swiss fablab Onlfait, are more suitable for smaller laser cutters.

### `onlfait/`
All CAD and other designs for the AstroPlant Onlfait casing / enclosure / top panel.
This casing design can be used with smaller laser cutters (900x600mm).
